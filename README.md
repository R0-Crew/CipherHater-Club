## [YOU SHOULD READ THIS BEFORE CONTACTING US](mailto:cipherhater@protonmail.com)

 I and my guys are not one of those cheap ass hackers here on deepweb who are trying to raise peanuts money, we are good with our skills and knowledgable with what we do. we can get job as an ethical hacker from most of the organisations who are looking for hackers with the skills and experience we have and, so if you are interested in contacting us you should also be ready and serious to bring a reasable task and coperate with our terms, we are not just looknig for customers here, but we are looking for serious minded people who need any of their hacking jobs to be done, no matter how hard or complicated thee job might be, we will bleed through it snd make sure we deliver to you on or before the expected day we promised. We came together with our individual skills to archeive a bigger goal of service.

**Why is hacking paid?** We do the **PRIMARY hack** – which no one has done yet. After we sell the hacked version it will be perhaps available throughout the public network for free and based on it you can hack versions for Mac and Windows. Now do you understand why this is so? Users who paid for hacking become members of the club and have a subscription for the lifetime of a certain version but do not have the right to distribute new versions on the internet. If a new version is found on the public network, then everyone who has a subscription will lose it without me asking who uploaded it on the warez sites.
